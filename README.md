HTTP server in C++

Team: bbrunet (@grim22) and julnolle (@sequoiageant)

HTTP compliant (cf RFC 7230 to 7235)

GET, POST, PUT, DELETE...

Upload of files to server (text, images, binary...)

CGI implemented (php-cgi and perl handled)

Testing:
- Compatible with Chrome or Firefox
- Tested via Telnet and Postman
- Stress tested via SIEGE
- 42 tester 100% OK

Server Configuration inspired from Nginx: 
- "Server block(s)": one or more servers listening on a given address/port, with "server-name" defined or not
- "Location block(s)": defining how to handle the request, depending on the URL  
- Directives implemented: root (=Nginx alias), error-page, index, autoindex, redirect, client_max_body_size, allowed_methods...

Notes on server: 
- all I/O with server is "non blocking"
- "select" function used before each call to recv and send

Notes on parsing:
- one request can be received in several recv/read
- one read/recv can reveive multiple request ("pipelining")
- "chunked" transfer encoding handled

Notes on CGI:
- CGI is called via a fork and an execve
- The body of the request is sent to the CGI via a pipe
- The CGI writes its output onto a file, and the server then reads from this file
- TO DO: try to communicate with CGI only with pipes (so far, causes deadlocks when body is too big)
- CGI environement variables are set by server. One of them ("PATH INFO") is the name of the script that is run

Notes on "non blocking"
- Non blocking can concern server socket or client socketd
- If server socket, it concerns accept()...
- If client socket, it concerns recv(), send()...
- 3 ways to make read and write operations "non blocking":
  1. Set the socket as non blocking, upon creation or using fcntl (flag O_NONBLOCK)
  2. Set the operation (recv, send) as non blocking each time you use the socket: recv(..., MSG_DONTWAIT) send(..., MSG_DONTWAIT)
  3. Go through select() before each call to recv/send
